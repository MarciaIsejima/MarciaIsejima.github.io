### Week 1
Decided on Project A topic: Building My First React Application.

Have found an interesting source for helping me in this project: the learning path ["Building a React App from Scratch"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths/learning-path-building/9781491991794) available at Safari Books Online. Apparently this tutorial is designed for entry-level application and web developers and have as main learning outcomes:
* the basics of React, such as components, state, props, life cycles, and JSX
* using React with CSS and backend servers
