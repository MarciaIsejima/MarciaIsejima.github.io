### Project B - Final considerations

Today I shared the learning outcomes of my MongoDB studies with the class, demonstrating the basic CRUD operations using MongoDB through a user admin module of a chat application and also pointing out the main differences between MongoDB and a relational SQL database.<br>
It really surprised my how NoSQL databases are highly used by the biggest companies such as Google, LinkedIn and Facebook.
The flexibility and scalability of this technology made possible for this companies to create awesome value to their customers through high velocity data delivery. I believe that's the reason NoSQL databases is being increasingly adopted by many companies in the industry as well. This is definetely an important asset to developers to have in their skill set.<br>
I'm really glad for having the opportunity to learn React and MongoDB, since I could apply my knowledge immediately on my Project 2 web application. The prototypes I built using the learning paths of Safari OnLine Library, although very simple, were very useful! I would come back to them many times after, using them as references when I had to develop my own application.<br>
Of course, there's still a lot to learn about React and MongoDB, but it was a good start. I certainly will continue to sharpen my skills on this two important tools in order to enhance my chances to get good job opportunities in the near future.<br>

Thank you Jordan!<br>
