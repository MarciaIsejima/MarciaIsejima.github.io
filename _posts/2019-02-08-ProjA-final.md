### Project A: final considerations

* Even thought the learning path was complete in terms of what it takes to build an application in React, 
including data persistence in a noSQL database, it is not enough to one get to know React fundamentals. 
Thereâ€™s the need to make many complimentary researches in order to make some concepts clearer.

* By elaborating the tutorial, I could learn much more about React than doing the learning path itself. 
Indeed, the best way to learn something is trying to explain it to someone else.

* I hope that, after doing this project, I can apply all my acquired knowledge on my Project 2 front-end development. 
Even though I feel that I could only scratch the surface of all capabilities of React and that there is still a 
long way to go to fully master this framework.
