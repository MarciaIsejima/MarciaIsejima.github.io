## Week 2

This week I started watching the learning path "Building a React App from Scratch" by Ally MacDonald.

Topics covered so far:
* Exploring some text editors
  Atom and VS Code were suggested by the instructor
* Installing React Developer Tools on Chrome
  Simply adding an extention to Chrome
* Creating my first React application using CLI commands:

```

  npm install -g create-react-app
  create-react-app notepad

  cd notepad
  npm start

```

* JSX introduction for React
  Embedding an external object's property inside an existing component. In the tutorial example, we added the user object's name property into the App component, which resulted in a Welcome Page with the user's name.
