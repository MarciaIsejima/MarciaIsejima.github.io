# Week 2

This week I started watching the learning path "Building a React App from Scratch" by Ally MacDonald.
Topics covered so far:
* Exploring some text editors (Atom and VS Code were suggested by the instructor)
* Installing React Developer Tools on Chrome (by simply adding an extention to Chrome)
* Creating my first React application using CLI
