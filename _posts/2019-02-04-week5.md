### Week 5

Finally I could finish building my React application, based on the learning path ["Building a React App from 
Scratch"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/learning-paths/learning-path-building/9781491991794) by Ally MacDonald. <br>

With the basic application up and running, I could elaborate the Tutorial document.

Items accomplished this week: 

1. Initial setup for Firebase (cloud database)
 
2. Creating new notes in the notepad, storing data into the database using Firebase functions

3. Retrieve created notes from Firebase

4. Delete notes from notepad and reflecting on Firebase database on real time.

* Final look of the application after connecting to Firebase:

* Visualizing changes in data reflected in Firebase website:

#### Roadblocks
 
* When passing functions from one component to another using `props`, I got some error messages and the application page would not load. Only after adapting the code slightly, I could get it right:

original code: `handleChange={this.state.handleChange.bind(this)}`

final code:  `handleChange={this.handleChange.bind(this)}`
 
 
#### Next Steps
 
* Finish writing the tutorial
