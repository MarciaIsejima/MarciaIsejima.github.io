### Week 10

#### Accomplishments
This week I worked on the demo chat application provided in the learning path. We modified the "Chat Rooms" admin module, accessing the chat rooms stored in our local MongoDB database, instead of loading them from the local JSON file. For this exercise we used the plain vanilla MongoDB driver for NodeJS. Tasks accomplished:
* Implemented the `find` method to retrieve chat rooms list
* Implemented `insertOne` method to create a new chat room
* Implemented `find` + `replaceOne` methods to edit a chat room name
* Implemented `deleteOne` method to delete a chat room

#### Road blocks:
The differences between the MongoDB versions used by the tutorial (2.1.14) and my newer version (3.1.13) led to many errors that made the process of following the tutorial very annoying. Some of the methods used in the tutorial didn't work. Eventually I tried to get the same deprecated version of the driver used by the author, but that let to other kind of errors that were impossible to track down. I have no choice but to go back to the 3.1.13 driver version. Unfortunately, I had to waste lots of time to go through this process. I wonder how this version differences can affect the stability of the applications in real world situations!

#### Next steps:
* Modify the "Users" admin module to access MongoDB, using a different driver: Mongoose (I hope this one works better!)
* Prepare presentation
