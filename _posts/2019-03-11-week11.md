### Week 11

This week I could complete the learning path, adapting the chat app's User admin tool to access a MongoDB database via Mongoose driver.

#### Accomplishments:
* Installed Mongoose driver
* Created Mongoose Schema and Models to access chat user information
* Used Mongoose Models to import chat users information from a JSON file.
* Adapted chat users admin module, implementing CRUD operations using Mongoose functions:
  * find()
  * save()
  * findById()
  * findByIdAndRemove()

#### Roadblocks
Complete this learning path was quite difficult for me, mainly because I'm still learning the fundamentals of NodeJS and Express. Also I had to struggle with MongoDB deprecated driver versions, which took me quite some time. Because of that, I'm afraid not having enough time to elaborate an original demo app out of this project, as my presentation is scheduled for this week and I need to prepare for it. 

#### Next steps
Prepare and present the project about MongoDB to the class on next Friday.
