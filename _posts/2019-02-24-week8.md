## Week 8

This week I started to watch the learning path.<br>
Apparently this learning path is in a continuation from another learning path about Node.js and Express. Maybe I should take a look at those videos as well.<br>
Anyway, there were some tasks I could accomplish this week:
* Install a MongoDB server locally
* Learning basic commands to interact with Mongo using shell prompt, such as:
  - `show dbs;`: shows a list of databases in the server
  - `use chat`: points to the chat database
  - `db.foo.find({"a":1})`: lists all documents in the foo collection where a property equals to 1
  - `db.foo.insert({"a":1})`: inserts a document into the foo collection
* Install and use Robomongo GUI tool as an alternative to interact with Mongo databases
* Cloned and installed the chat application that will be used as demo in this learning path:
