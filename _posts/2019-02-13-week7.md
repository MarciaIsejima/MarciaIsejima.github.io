### Week 7 - Project B Start

Today I published my Project B proposal about MongoDB. From what I saw until now, I think it's going to be very easy to understand and learn how to use MongoDB as database. My main concern is related to NodeJS, which is something that I also have to learn about at the same time. I hope I can manage it.
The learning path that I chose is [“Using MongoDB with Node.js”](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/videos/using-mongodb-with/9781491959084) by Wes Higbee, who also have some tutorials on NodeJS. Maybe I should take a look at those before I go for the tutorial on MongoDB.
