#Project B: MongoDB

##Description
Learn how to use MongoDB with NodeJS to persist data in a chat sample application.

##Objectives
- Learn how to connect to a MongoDB server, using both the command line and a GUI tool.
- Learn how to manipulate documents in MongoDB via NodeJS driver
- Learn the main differences between MongoDB and a relational database such as SQL

##Rationale
In my previous working experience, I used extensively SQL databases to store data. I can say that I have a good understanding of how it works. But it’s been a while since I started to realize that noSQL databases became a very widespread technology in industry. But, although we had a brief introduction to Firebase in our WMDD Intro to Web Development course, it wasn’t still clear for me how could we store more complex data structures in a simple document. 
Talking to our instructors in Langara, they encouraged my team to go for MongoDB as the database technology for our Project 2 application, as an opportunity to master this technology, which is a valuable asset in the development job market.
